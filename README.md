Euler characteristics of complete intersections in products of projective space

I was thinking about the question "is a central simple algebra always split by a genus 1 curve?" I tried to modify the approach of de Jong, Ho (https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4810), to find Galois-invariant complete intersections in products of projective space. The Euler characteristic of a complete intersection subscheme of n divisors (of arbitrary multidegrees) in an arbitrary product of projective spaces is an alternating sum of 2^n terms, each of which is a product of binomial coefficients; it can be computed using the Kunneth formula by induction on n. It is natural to arrange these multidegrees as a matrix, see for example this paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0550321388903525.
