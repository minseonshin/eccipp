Euler characteristics of complete intersections in products of projective space

I was thinking about the question "is a central simple algebra always split by a genus 1 curve?" I tried to modify the approach of de Jong, Ho (https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4810), to find Galois-invariant complete intersections in products of projective space. I wrote a program "eccipp-d.c" to compute the Euler characteristics of complete intersection subschemes of various products of projective space.
